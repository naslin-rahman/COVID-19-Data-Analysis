# CSC343-Project
Our domain is the COVID-19 cases in Toronto (October 2020) and we will be using the dataset found on the Toronto Open Data Portal in the following link.  

Link: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/

This dataset contains information about Covid-19 cases that occurred in Toronto, including status of the case and age group of the patient. To further understand the dataset, we would need to get a better understanding of a few attributes such as the role of intubation in the treatment of Covid19 and what different sources of infections mean. 

The questions that we would like to explore using these dataset's is: 
1. Does the population of the neighbourhood affect the amount of covid cases (this includes probable and confirmed cases) ? Income of neighbourhood?
2. Neighbourhoods with 40 or more fatal cases.
3. Do neighbourhoods with significantly more fatal cases also have a higher population of elerderly people (65+) ? Done by finding neighbourhoods with 40+ fatal cases and finding the amount of 65+ ppl in that neighbourhood? Compare that to the avg number of elderly people in neighbourhoods across all 140 neighbourhoods.
4. Does infection type affect fatality rate?
